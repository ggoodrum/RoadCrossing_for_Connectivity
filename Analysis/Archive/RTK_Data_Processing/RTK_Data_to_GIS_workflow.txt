1. Run raw RTK data through processing code in R.

2. Import processed RTK data into ArcPRO.

3. Project processed RTK data using 'XY Table to Point', set coordinate system to Projected -> UTM -> NAD83 -> Zone 12N

4. Calculate distance between points using 'Generate Near Table'.

5. Add UID for IN_FID and NEAR_FID by using 'Join Field' with the RTK spatial data.

6. Attribute to master data set.
